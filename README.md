# GAZA-PROJECT
PROJECT TITLE: GAZA PROJECT WITH ZION TECH

i. Most of the cities in the dataset do not exist in the map, the location/areas. Such cities are Haiti, Ethiopia, Guinea, Guinea Bussua etc. They are known as slums and impoverished areas in the Palaetestine Territories (Gaza Stripe)
ii. From the Fatalities Map, Haiti had the highest fatality rate with 796k deaths, and Gaza City was affected with 713k fatality rates, while Gaza City had the highest injury rates.
iii. Deir al-Balah was the third city with a high fatality rate of 338k.

iv. The common incidents with the highest fatality rates were the Airstrike and Building collapse, with death tolls of 879,578 and 558,455. While the least incident was a Drone strike. Sepsis leads to a high cause of death by injuries.
v. Haiti had the most fatalities of 795,794 deaths due to lack of medical reach.
vi. Gaza City had 597,840 fatalities, with the most recorded injuries of 273,557; all these individuals lacked medical access, while 115,281 fatalities and 108 injuries were due to direct conflict. Gaza City had a total of 713,121 deaths. 

Role: I identified cities with the most fatalities and in urgent need of medical attention.

HAITI, GAZA CITY, DEIR AL-BALAH, AND NORTH GAZA ARE IN URGENT NEED OF MEDICAL HELP; ATTENTION SHOULD BE GIVEN TO THESE CITIES TO REDUCE THE HIGH RATES OF FATALITIES.
